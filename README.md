# Week 1

- The term Deep Learning, refers to traiing Neural Networks, sometimes, very large Neural Networks
- Activation function: ReLU function (Rectified Linear Unit) f(x) = max(0,x)

- Every input layer feature is interconnected with every hidden layer feature
- The  applications of deep learning today are online advertising, computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, autonomous driving
- For image application, we usually use CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- For sequence data, like audio, we usually use RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Structure Data: basically databases of data, each of the features has a very well defined meaning
- In contrast, unstructured data refers to things like audio, raw audio or images where you might want to recognize whats in the image. The features might be the pixel values in an image or the individual works in a piece of text.
- Why Deep Learning takes off in recent years:

1. Deep learning has resulted in significant improvements in important applications such as online advertising, speech recognition, and image recognition. 
2. We have access to a lot more computational power.
3. We have access to a lot more data.
- One of the huge breakthroughs in Neural Networks is the switching from the sigmoid activation function to the ReLU activation function. And this switch make gradient descent worksd much faster
